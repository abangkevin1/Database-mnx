#Project Title:Clinic Booking System

#Description of what your project does
A Clinic Booking System is designed to streamline the process of scheduling and managing patient appointments in a healthcare facility. It allows patients to book appointments online or via an app, reducing the need for phone calls and in-person scheduling.

For clinics, it helps organize patient visits, manage doctor availability, send automated reminders to reduce no-shows, and maintain patient records. Some systems even integrate billing and insurance features, making administrative tasks more efficient.

#How to run/setup the project (or import SQL)

### **1. Setting Up the Project**
- **Install Dependencies:** Ensure you have the necessary tools, such as a web server (Apache, Nginx), a database server (MySQL, PostgreSQL), and any required programming environments (PHP, Python, Node.js, etc.).
- **Clone or Download the Project Files:** If you are using a prebuilt system, obtain the source code from a repository or download it.
- **Configure Environment Variables:** Set up configuration files (`.env` or similar) to match your database and server settings.

### **2. Importing the SQL Database**
- **Open Your Database Management Tool:** You can use MySQL Workbench, phpMyAdmin, or a terminal for MySQL/PostgreSQL.
- **Create a New Database:** Run `CREATE DATABASE clinic_booking;` (adjust the name based on your system).
- **Import the SQL File:**
  - Using phpMyAdmin: Navigate to the "Import" section, select your `.sql` file, and execute.
  - Using MySQL Command Line: Run `mysql -u username -p clinic_booking < database.sql`.
- **Check Tables and Data:** Ensure all tables are created correctly and the default data (if any) is imported.

### **3. Running the Application**
- **Start the Server:** Depending on your stack:
  - For PHP: Run `php -S localhost:8000`.
  - For Node.js: Use `npm start` or `node server.js`.
  - For Django/Flask (Python): Run `python manage.py runserver`.
- **Access the Application:** Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:8000` or your configured domain.
- **Test Booking Features:** Try adding appointments, checking availability, and ensuring email/SMS notifications work (if applicable).
